## Installation

The user will have to clone the repo, and in gitbash they will need to install all of the packages "npm i" in the root directory. Then the user will have to run "npm run develop" to concurrently run the server and the client application. The server will run on port 3001 and the client runs on port 3000.

Required modules and dependencies are: apollo-server-express^3.11.1, express^4.17.2 and graphql^15.8.0

## Usage

 Once the user has done "npm run develop" the book search engine will spin up on the browser. The user will have the option to Login/Signup and there will be a search field where the user can input a book title and hit the submit button to search.
